Faker provides fake data to your Android MPVs. Now it's very handy to make screenshots of your apps without worrying with Google Play copyright infringments, e.g [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.kimo.tmdb). Faker helps you to populate your views with random data quickly and painlessly.

##Demo
The sample application (the source is in the **app** folder) has been published on Google Play to facilitate the access:

The demo app has a very clean MVP architecture based in the idea of [this post](http://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/). Feel free to give me suggestions.

##Setup

Gradle:

``` groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.thiagokimo:faker:1.4.1'
}
```

Maven:

``` xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.thiagokimo</groupId>
    <artifactId>faker</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.1</version>
</dependency>
```

##Usage

###The "lazy" way

``` java
Faker.with(context)
      .fill(rootView);
```

Faker will figure out all views inside the one you passed to it and fill it with proper data. Just like that!

By default faker will fill **TextViews** with lorem ipsum, **ImageViews** with a random color, **CompoundButtons** with a random state (check or uncheck) and **ProgressBars** with a random progress value.

###The specific way

``` java
Faker.with(context)
      .NameOfTheComponent
      .componentMethod();
```

Check out all examples [here](https://github.com/thiagokimo/Faker/tree/master/app/src/main/java/io/kimo/faker/mvp/presenter).

##Components

Faker is organized in components that provides you specific types of data. Here is a list of the current components:
